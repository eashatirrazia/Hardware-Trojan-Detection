- replicate the existing results with the new data (alpha, beta bs)


new set of experiments
- R-series (25 TjIn + 1 TjFree)(10 gh + 15 th)
- B-15 series (4 TjIn + 1 TjFree)(th)
- S-series (10 TjIn + 4 TjFree)(th)
- PIC-series (4 TjIn + 1 TjFree)(gh)


Positive class: TjIn
Negative class: TjFree

metrics:
[[TN, FN][FP ,TP]]
confusion matrix
F1, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

testing data:
- R-series (10 + 15)
- S-series
- PIC-series
- B-series
- gh data

//exp1:
pretrained model, test on testing data
keep names of the detected files as well

//exp2:
create new dataset for github data
scratch training 23 gh files ()
testing on testing data

//exp3:
from scratch S-series

exp4:
train on highlighted
test on the S-series

//exp5:
train on consolidated data

//exp6:
train on denial of service

exp7: (mustafa)
train with agcn on S-series

exp8: (mustafa)
train with agcn on all data

//exp9:
DOS copy

->exp10:
prepare test dataset for all 4 experiments and perform inference
